# ECE-449

VHDL files of modules used to design and implement a basic CPU with a datapath.
Final project synthesis was carried out using Xilinx Vivado, thus project files
are not included here. A Basys 3 FPGA was used for implementation, with an
STM32F4 Discovery board used as a bootloader; again neither the constraints nor
the bootloader are included here.
